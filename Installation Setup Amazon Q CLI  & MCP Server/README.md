-In this blog we have used uvx
-If you want to install simply use the commands

**MacOS**
```bash
brew install uv
```
---

**Linux / WSL**

```bash
sudo snap install astral-uv --classic
```

Now create a file called mcp.json in ~/.aws/amazon

```bash
vim mcp.json
```
- Paste the below code Press i to code

```bash
{

	"mcpServers" : {
    
 "awslabs.cdk-mcp-server": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["awslabs.cdk-mcp-server@latest"],
        "env": {
           "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
        }
   },
 "awslabs.aws-diagram-mcp-server": {
 		"command": "uvx",
 		"args": ["awslabs.aws-diagram-mcp-server"],
 		"env": {
 			"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
 		},
 		"autoApprove": [],
 		"disabled": false
 	}
}

}
```

Save & Exit - esc :wq enter

```bash
cat mcp.json
```

---

or 

1. Clone the MCP server repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-mcp-server.git
    cd amazon-q-mcp-server
    ```

2. Build and start the server (example using Docker Compose):

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3. Configure your Amazon Q CLI or extension to point to your MCP server instance as described in the server documentation.

4. For detailed configuration, refer to the [official MCP Server documentation](https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-mcp-server).

Login again using **q login** and check for **uvx** command

##TIP 

If you want to switch your windows terminal to Ubuntu 

```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04
```
Before that check the list distros by:

```bash
wsl -l -v (or) wsl --list --verbose
```

Ask Amazon q cli to copy your directory to windows if you want because all files created will be in root directory of Ubuntu (Windows users)
