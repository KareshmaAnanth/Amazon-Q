Create a Flask web application called tamil_quotes_app.py that serves as a platform for sharing and discovering Tamil quotes. The application should:

1. Use Flask as the web framework with SQLAlchemy for database operations
2. Implement user authentication with Flask-Login including registration, login, and logout functionality
3. Store Tamil quotes with the following information:
   - The quote content in Tamil
   - English translation
   - Source/attribution
   - Category
   - Date added
   - User who added it
   - Number of likes

4. Include the following features:
   - Homepage displaying all quotes
   - Random quote generator
   - Ability for logged-in users to add new quotes
   - Like functionality for quotes
   - Filter quotes by category
   - View quotes by specific users
   - User profile pages

5. Include sample data with at least 3 traditional Tamil quotes with their translations
6. Implement proper password hashing for security
7. Include database initialization code that creates an admin user and adds sample quotes on first run

The application should be well-structured, include appropriate error handling, and follow Flask best practices.
