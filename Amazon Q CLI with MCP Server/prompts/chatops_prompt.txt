Create a Python script using the diagrams library that generates a visual architecture diagram for a DevOps ChatOps bot. The architecture should include:

1. Users interacting with the bot through Slack and Microsoft Teams
2. An API Gateway for external communication
3. Amazon Lex for intent recognition
4. EventBridge for event routing
5. Lambda functions for command processing and response formatting
6. Amazon Bedrock for AI/ML capabilities
7. CloudWatch for monitoring and metrics
8. SNS for alerts and notifications
9. S3 for storing conversation logs

The diagram should show the flow of information between these components, including:
- How user requests flow from chat platforms through the system
- How responses are generated and returned
- How monitoring and alerting works
- How conversation logs are stored

Name the output file "devops_chatops_architecture.png" and include appropriate clusters to group related components.
